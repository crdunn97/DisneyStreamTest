Instructions:
1. Open Solution in Visual Studio
2. Update Filepath on line 20 of DisneyStreamTest.cpp to valid local path, I reccomend using your download folder but any folder that doesn't require admin access should do.
3. Build the solution
4. Run the built .exe file
5. Follow the instructions in the console
